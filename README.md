# Hello:)

By link below you can see an example of my work written using HTML and CSS. My favorite messenger is Telegram so I tried to create this. Unfortunately, CSS features are not as great as JS and some things don't work as expected. But this didn't stop my app from being worse than the real one.


I have prepared for you a brief overview of my work at first page:)
